## Overview
An end-to-end data analysis project examining COVID-19 data using SQL for data exploration and Tableau for visualization.

## Tools Used
- SQL (data querying and analysis)
- Tableau (data visualization)
- Excel/CSV (data storage)

## Data Source
Data sourced from [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) covering cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations globally.

## the final result:
### Covid Cases

## Project Structure
1. **Data Exploration**: SQL queries to understand patterns, trends, and key metrics
2. **Data Visualization**: Tableau dashboards showing insights from the analysis

## SQL Analysis
The SQL scripts examine:
- Global infection rates and mortality
- Country-specific comparisons
- Vaccination progress
- Correlation between various factors

## Tableau Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes:
- Global infection map
- Time series analysis of cases and deaths
- Vaccination progress by country
- Comparative analysis across regions
